Demo: http://rawgit.com/davidrs/sfhip-map/master/index.html

Code was written for SFHIP at Code for SF hack nights.


## Data

Data is from SFHIP  google drive folders, 
In particular: ```.../New Files/counts_census_by_alcohol_license_melted.csv```
and ```.../ABC_licenses_by_census_tract/ABC_licenses_by_census_tract.csv```

As best I can tell it's 2014 data.


## Code

The code uses LeafletJS the standard for open source mapping projects.
Currently uses MapBox default for tile serving, should migrate to something scalable and free. OSM etc.
